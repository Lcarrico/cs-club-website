					<p>
						The Computer Science Club's (CS Club) mission is to give Lake Forest College's student body the opportunity to further their fundamental understanding of computer science and other technologies, to provide the proper resources and support, and to establish strong bonds between computer science aficionados. We hope to give an benefit of expanded horizons and a more mature, complete worldview focused on computer science and related technologies.

					<h3>Resources</h3>
					<p>
					CS Club serves as a resource to support and teach students about computer science, both in their schoolwork and in their 
					personal projects. We provide opportunities to learn new tools and programming languages, and we offer tutoring for 
					computer science classes. We also can act as a liaison to connect CS students looking to gain practical experience with 
					students from other departments who are working on projects that require some programming knowledge.
					</p>

					<h3>Networking</h3>
					<p>
					We provide opportunities for CS students to connect with members of the broader tech community by hosting events such 
					as talks by potential employers, and Q&A panels with Lake Forest alumni who work in the tech industry. We serve as a contact 
					point for individuals outside the college who are interested in hiring Lake Forest computer science students. We also 
					collaborate with the Math & Computer Science faculty to find new opportunities for our club members.
					</p>

				<div class="column">
					<img src="Research Icon.png" alt="Research"/> 
					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>
					We support students' academic interests by providing tutorials and workshops that enable further research and projects. 
					Past tutorial subjects have included Github, HTML & CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, Python, Processing, Twine, Tracery, and more! 
					These projects help students to learn the necessary skills to pursue their own research and professional interests, 
					and assist them in preparing for a career working with technology.
